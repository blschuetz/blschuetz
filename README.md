Hi, Iâ€™m Bene.

Currently I am working on obtaining my Masters Degree in AI Engineering/ Data Science.

I would love to learn about integrating Machine Learning technologies in embedded systems, especially control systems.

Initially I learned programming in Java, but switched to Python for its great ecosystem and academic necessities. 
My goal is to learn C/C++ and finally get my roomba to dust off our floor properly ;-)

Cheers
