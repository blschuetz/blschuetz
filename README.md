Hi, Iâ€™m Bene.

Currently I am working on obtaining my Masters Degree in AI Engineering.

My main focus of interest is applying Machine Learning technologies on embedded systems, especially control systems.

I initially learned programming in Java, but switched to Python for its great ecosystem and academic necessities. 
My goal is to learn C++ and finally get my roomba to dust off our floor properly ;-)

Cheers
